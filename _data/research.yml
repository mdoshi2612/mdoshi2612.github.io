  description: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is the task involves retrieving images from a large database based on a query composed of multiple elements, such as text, images, and sketches. The goal is to develop algorithms that can understand and combine multiple sources of information to accurately retrieve images that match the query, extending the userâ€™s expression ability.

  description: Automated visualization recommendation (Vis-Rec) models help users to derive crucial insights from new datasets. Typically, such automated Vis-Rec models first calculate a large number of statistics from the datasets and then use machine-learning models to score or classify multiple visualizations choices to recommend the most effective ones, as per the statistics.
