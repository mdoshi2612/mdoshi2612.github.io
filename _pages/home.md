<span style="font-weight:500; font-size: 25px" > Hello there!</span>

I am a undergraduate student at the [Indian Institute of Technology](https://www.iitb.ac.in/) where I am pursuing the a B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering and minoring in Artificial Intelligence. I have been a part of the [Unnmesh Mashruwala Innovation Cell](https://umiciitb.github.io/) at IIT Bombay where I worked on developing Computer Vision Pipelines for autonomous drones<br>

I previously worked in Control Systems at the [Indian Institute of Technology Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/) where I developed algorithms to approximate feedback maps for Linear Quadratic Regulator controllers.<br>

During my undergraduate studies, I interned at [Adobe Research](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/infolab/) where I worked on scaling visualisation recommendation systems. I did my Undergraduate Thesis on Composed Image Retrieval with the guidance of [Prof. Banerjee](https://biplab-banerjee.github.io/).<br>

I intend to use this website to give the world a peek into my mind and to share updates about my work.

<h4>Research Interests</h4>
My primary research interests lie in the dynamic and rapidly evolving field of computer vision, with a particular focus on its diverse applications and the intersection with vision-language models. I am passionate about exploring innovative approaches and advancing the state-of-the-art in computer vision to address real-world challenges and enhance various domains.
