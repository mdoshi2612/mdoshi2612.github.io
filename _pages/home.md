<span style="font-weight:500; font-size: 25px" > Hello there!</span>

I am currently a graduate student pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/). I am also working at the [4D CELL Lab](https://www.schoeneberglab.org/) at UCSD as a Graduate Student Researcher (GSR) under the guidance of [Prof. Johannes Sch√∂neberg](https://pharmacology.ucsd.edu/faculty/department-faculty/johannes-schoneberg.html) where I work on leveraging self-supervised deep learning methods to extract information from 4D Microscopy Data. <br>

During the summer of 2023, I interned at [Adobe](https://research.adobe.com/) where I worked on scaling visualisation recommendation systems using Reinforcement Learning and Feature Selection methods. This internship culminated in us filing a patent and publishing a paper on the same at PAKDD 2024. <br>

During my undergraduate studies at the [Indian Institute of Technology](https://www.iitb.ac.in/), I earned my Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering and had the privilege to work with various research groups. I did my Undergraduate Thesis on Composed Image Retrieval with the guidance of [Prof. Banerjee](https://biplab-banerjee.github.io/). I have also been a part of the [Unnmesh Mashruwala Innovation Cell](https://umiciitb.github.io/) at IIT Bombay where I worked on developing CV tracking pipelines on objects for IARC Mission 9, where we were awarded the special mention as a team. I previously worked in Control Systems at the [Indian Institute of Technology Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/) where I developed algorithms to approximate feedback maps for Linear Quadratic Regulator controllers.<br>

I am deeply interested in the field of computer vision, particularly in how artificial intelligence can be harnessed to tackle complex societal challenges and create meaningful, positive change. My passion for exploring these areas is driven by the immense potential to develop innovative solutions that enhance the human experience and contribute positively to the world. Outside of work, I enjoy watching and keeping up with football. Whether it's following my favorite teams, catching live matches, or staying updated on the latest news and scores, football is a major passion of mine. <br>

I intend to use this website to give the world a peek into my mind and to share updates about my work.
